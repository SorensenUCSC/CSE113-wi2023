## Class Description

Welcome to CSE 113: Parallel and Concurrent Programming! In this class, we will explore many aspects of parallel computing, from instruction-level parallelism in seemingly sequential programs to thread-level parallel programs that can efficiently execute across the many cores of today's multiprocessors. We will learn how to write programs that execute efficiently and correctly in concurrent environments. This class will give you the necessary foundation to solve problems using concurrency: a powerful skillset as today's computers are becoming more and more parallel.

This page will be filled in closer to the start of the quarter.
