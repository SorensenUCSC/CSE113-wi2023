I will update these references as the course progresses with additional resources that you might find helpful. Please let me know if there's anything you'd like me to include!

### Textbooks

I do not require that you have a physical textbook for this class, however there are some that we will use extensively. Each are available online from the UCSC library.

* The main book we will use is [The Art of Multiprocessor Programming](https://ucsc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CDL_SCR_INST/15r5l0d/alma9914804965806531).
* For those of you who have not taken CSE 120, you may find [Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach](https://ucsc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CDL_SCR_INST/15r5l0d/alma9914804950506531) helpful. Chapter 2 deals with the memory hierarchy and Chapter 3 deals with hardware for instruction level parallelism.
* For more information on GPU computing, I recommend [CUDA by Example](https://ucsc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CDL_SCR_INST/ojisf2/cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9780132180139).
