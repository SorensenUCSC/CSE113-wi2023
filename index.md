Hello and welcome to the parallel and concurrent programming class! In this class, you will learn the fundamentals of parallel programming concepts, including parallel programming models, reasoning about concurrency, and implementing synchronization idioms. Over the last decade, systems have become more and more parallel, from our phones to supercomputers. Now, nearly every modern device now contains many compute units (e.g., CPUs). These different compute units can work together to solve problems more efficiently than individual cores; however, they must be programmed carefully, both in terms of performance and safety. We will learn how to approach parallel programming, from high-level reasoning to concrete implementations.

This class is scheduled to be _in person_. We will follow the university guidelines and adapt if necessary, However, please be aware that this is not an asynchronous class and I expect you to make an effort to attend in-person classes. We will do our best to accomodate temporary remote attendance if needed (e.g., if you get sick). If your situation requires asynchronous courses, I suggest you contact an undergraduate adviser to discuss alternative options.
